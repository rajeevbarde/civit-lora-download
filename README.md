## Database Setup

The table used for this project is named `ALLCivitData`.

### Steps to Set Up the Database:
1. Download the SQLite database from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jMbwb3HUcDNB2H6n1GXt2WKK-COpbdrQ).
2. Once downloaded, execute the SQL script found in `civitalldata.sql` against the downloaded database. This will generate the `ALLCivitData` table from the existing database.

Make sure you have SQLite installed to run the SQL script.
