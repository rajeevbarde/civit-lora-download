## About the Warning Message

The warning appears because this app uses a sample of a community-scraped CivitAI database (Data till May 2025). The full collection is available via a Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kfvt73/civitai_model_database_checkpoints_and_loras/). This just lets you know you're viewing a limited dataset.

I used that database to create a new minimal version focused on LoRA models.

**To use the minimal LoRA database:**

1. Download the file from [this link](#) (link placeholder).
2. Save the downloaded file in a suitable folder where you can easily find and access it later.
3. Follow the next App configuration guide to complete the setup.

## App Configuration Guide

### Database Path Location

1. Set the full file path to the database file you downloaded in the previous steps.
2. Press the **Verify** button to check the database file.
3. Press the **Save DB path** button to save your configuration.
